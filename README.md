This project demonstrates how to use Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) to interact with a relational database. It covers essential CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SQL queries and demonstrates how to connect to a database from a Java application.

Features
Database Connection: Establishes a connection between Java and the database using JDBC.
CRUD Operations:
Create: Insert records into the database.
Read: Retrieve data from the database.
Update: Modify existing records.
Delete: Remove records from the database.
Error Handling: Manages SQL exceptions effectively.
Prepared Statements: Uses parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection.
